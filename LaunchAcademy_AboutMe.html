		<h1> About Me </h1>
		<h2> Hi </h2>
		<p> Hello! My name is Julissa Jansen-Morales and I'm an all-around nerd. I was the type of kid who would take things apart 
		(remotes, video game controls, pagers) to see the insides, but got in trouble when I couldn't put it back together.</p>
		<h2> Why Launch Academy </h2>
		<p> I received my degree in communications from Simmons College. While I worked with a lot of digital design 
		(using Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator) I never learned how to code the design for web. It wasn't until I had my first "real" job that
		I had to teach myself CSS, HTML, and Javascript. While teaching myself, I also learned that I loved to code. I started using 
		Coursera, Khan Academy, Code Academy, and LPTHW to teach myself.</p>
		<p> Working for a non-profit organization that promotes STEM education, I witness the gender gap in STEM fields constantly. 
		With only <a href="http://www.commerce.gov/blog/2011/08/03/women-stem-opportunity-and-imperative"> 24% of women working in a STEM career,</a> 
		I feel like it is a responsibility of mine to help close that gap. I want to learn programming from the best and use
		 that knowledge to empower young women to get into the STEM field.</p>
		 <p> Lauch Academy seeks to find motivated individuals who want to develop for the web. I am a very motivated and curious 
		 individual. I will take what I learn through Launch Academy and use it for social good.</p>

		 <p align="justified">When interested in a hobby, I always check to see if there are any conferences or meetups. I love comic books and video games, so I went to Comic-Con 2013 and cosplayed at Nathan Drake from the Uncharted video game series.</p></div>
